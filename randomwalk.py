# Implementing PageRank using random walks
# Procedure :
# 1. Create/take a directed graph.
# 2. Initially all the nodes have zero points.
# 3. Select a random node and make it the start node.
# 4. Perform random walks on the graph with the goal of visiting each node at least once. 
# 	4.1. When a node is visited, increment its point(s) by one.
# 	4.2. If a node having no outlinks is reached, do teleportation, and resume the random walk.
# 5. Rank the nodes according to their accumulated points. 
# 6. Compare the ranking generated with the inbuilt PageRank algorithm function.
